A 0.375 in diameter aluminum cable with a modulus of elasticity of 10 × 10⁶ psi is stretched between two towers 200 ft apart under an initial tension of 3000 lbf. A tensioning device is used to increase the tension in the cable to 9000 lbf.

Determine the additional length of cable the tensioning device must pull to achieve the new tension.

## Solution:

### Given:

$$
    \begin{aligned}
        Diameter,D &= 0.375 [in] \\
        Length,L &= 200 [ft] = 2400 [in] \\
        YoungsMod,E &= 10 \times 10^6 \\
        T_i &= 3000 [lbf] \\
        T_f &= 9000 [lbf] \\

    \end{aligned}
$$

### Solve for the cross-sectional area of the cable:

$$
    \begin{aligned}
        A &= \frac{\pi D^2}{4} = \frac{\pi (0.375)^2}{4} \\
        A &= 0.1104 [in^2]
    \end{aligned}
$$

### Solve for the elongation under both loads:

Elongation is defined as

$$
    \begin{aligned}
        \Delta L &= \frac{PL}{AE}
    \end{aligned}
$$

Elongation under the intial load, $$T_i$$:

$$
    \begin{aligned}
        \Delta L_i &= \frac{(3000[lbf])(2400[in])}{(0.1104 [in^2])(10 \times 10^6[psi])} \\
        \Delta L_i &= 6.52 [in]
    \end{aligned}
$$

Elongation under the intial load, $$T_f$$:

$$
    \begin{aligned}
        \Delta L_f &= \frac{(9000[lbf])(2400[in])}{(0.1104 [in^2])(10 \times 10^6[psi])} \\
        \Delta L_f &= 19.57 [in]
    \end{aligned}
$$

### Solve for the additional wire length to pull:

$$
    \begin{aligned}
        \Delta L &= \Delta L_f - \Delta L_i \\
        \Delta L &= 19.57[in] - 6.52[in] = 13.05 [in]
    \end{aligned}
$$

### Final Answer: 13.05 [in]
